## **Non-Functional Requirements**
1. **Usability**:
   - The backend interface must be clear and well-documented for future integrations.

2. **Performance**:
   - The app must process a request in under 2 seconds (API limit).

3. **Scalability**:
   - Support multiple requests without exceeding InstagAPI limits.

4. **Reliability**:
   - Handle API errors (e.g., request limits) with clear messages and fallback options.

---

## **Limitations**
1. The app can only analyze public profiles or those for which the user has explicitly granted consent.
2. **InstagAPI Limits**:
   - Maximum of 50 requests in the free version.
   - Limited access to hashtag data for unlinked users.
3. **Gemini API Limits**:
   - Dependency on predictive and multimodal analysis subject to daily usage limits.
4. Geographic and music data may be incomplete in certain regions.

---

## **Technologies Used**
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI for development speed and performance.
- **APIs**:
  - **InstagAPI**: For gathering profile, post, hashtag, and location data.
  - **Gemini AI API**: For advanced analysis and suggestion generation.
- **Database**: SQLite for simplicity in data management during the hackathon.

## **Hackathon Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: API Integration (November 8, evening)**
**Objective**: Connect the application to Instagram and Gemini APIs to collect data and generate suggestions.  
- **Activities**:
  1. Configure authentication with InstagAPI.
  2. Connect with Gemini API for predictive analysis.
  3. Create basic endpoints in `src/main.py` for:
